# Creating a Class

This guide will show you how to create a class using the `srs-lib` SDK. A class is a template that defines the structure and behavior of records that can be created under it.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- A Solana wallet with SOL for transaction fees
- Access to a Solana RPC endpoint

## Installation

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install srs-lib @solana/kit @solana/signers bs58
```

## Structure

```typescript
export type ClassAccountData = {
    discriminator: number;
    authority: PublicKey;
    isPermissioned: boolean;
    isFrozen: boolean;
    name: string;
    metadata: string;
};
```

```

## Explanation

Let's break down the key components of creating a class:

1. **Initialization**: We set up the Solana client with RPC and WebSocket connections.

2. **Keypairs**: We create keypairs for:
   - `payer`: The account that will pay for the transaction
   - `authority`: The account that will have control over the class

3. **Class Input**: We define the class data including:
   - `payer`: The account that will pay for the transaction
   - `authority`: The account that will have control over the class
   - `name`: The name of the class
   - `description`: A description of the class
   - `schema`: A JSON Schema that defines the structure of records that can be created under this class

4. **Transaction Creation**:
   - Create the class instruction
   - Get the latest blockhash
   - Create and configure the transaction message
   - Sign the transaction
   - Send and confirm the transaction

## Schema Definition

The schema is a crucial part of class creation as it defines:
- The structure of records that can be created under this class
- The data types and validation rules for each field
- Required and optional fields
- Nested object structures
- Array types and their item types

## Error Handling

The code includes basic error handling that will:
- Log any errors that occur during the class creation process
- Throw the error for further handling if needed

## Important Notes

- The class authority will have control over all records created under this class
- The schema cannot be modified after class creation
- Records created under this class must conform to the defined schema
- The class name should be unique within your application

## Next Steps

After creating a class, you might want to:
- [Create a record](./creating-a-record) under this class
- [Fetch a record](./fetching-a-record) to verify the class structure
- Update or burn records under this class

const transaction = createRecord(context, {
    owner: owner,
    class: classPublicKey,
    record: recordPublicKey,
    systemProgram: systemProgramPublicKey,
    authority: authority, // Required if class is permissioned
    expiration: 0, // No expiration
    name: "Example Record",
    data: JSON.stringify({
        title: "My Record",
        description: "This is an example record",
        // Additional data conforming to the class schema
    })
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The record's data must conform to the schema defined in its class
- For permissioned classes, the authority must be provided and must be the class authority
- The record owner will have control over the record and can update or burn it
- The expiration timestamp is optional (use 0 for no expiration)
- The record name should be unique within its class
- The data must be properly serialized according to the class schema

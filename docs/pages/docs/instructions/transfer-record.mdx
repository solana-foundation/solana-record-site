# Transfer Record

Transfers ownership of a record to a new owner.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `authority` | `Signer` | The record owner or class authority (for permissioned classes) |
| `record` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The record account to be transferred |
| `class?` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Optional class account of the record |
| `newOwner` | `PublicKey` | The public key of the new owner |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { transferRecord } from "srs-lib";

const transaction = transferRecord(context, {
    authority: authority,
    record: recordPublicKey,
    class: classPublicKey, // Optional, but recommended for permissioned classes
    newOwner: newOwnerPublicKey
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The authority must be either the current record owner or the class authority (for permissioned classes)
- The new owner will have full control over the record after transfer
- The record's data remains unchanged during transfer
- If the record is tokenized, the token must be transferred separately
- For permissioned classes, providing the class account is recommended to ensure proper authority verification
- The transfer is permanent and cannot be undone
- The new owner must be a valid Solana account

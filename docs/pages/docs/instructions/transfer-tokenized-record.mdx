## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `authority` | `Signer` | The record owner or class authority (for permissioned classes) |
| `mint` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The mint account for the tokenized record |
| `tokenAccount` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The source token account holding the tokenized record |
| `newTokenAccount` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The destination token account that will receive the tokenized record |
| `record` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The record account associated with the tokenized record |
| `token2022?` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Optional Token2022 Program account |
| `class?` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Optional class account of the record |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { transferTokenizedRecord } from "srs-lib";

const transaction = transferTokenizedRecord(context, {
    authority: authority,
    mint: mintPublicKey,
    tokenAccount: sourceTokenAccountPublicKey,
    newTokenAccount: destinationTokenAccountPublicKey,
    record: recordPublicKey,
    token2022: token2022ProgramPublicKey,
    class: classPublicKey // Optional, but recommended for permissioned classes
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The authority must be either the record owner or the class authority (for permissioned classes)
- The tokenized record must not be frozen
- The source token account must hold exactly one token
- The destination token account must be owned by the recipient
- The record's data remains unchanged during transfer
- For permissioned classes, providing the class account is recommended to ensure proper authority verification
- The transfer is permanent and cannot be undone
- The record ownership is automatically transferred to the new token account owner

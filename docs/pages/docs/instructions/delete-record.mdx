# Delete Record

Permanently deletes a record from the blockchain. This operation cannot be undone.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `authority` | `Signer` | The record owner or class authority (for permissioned classes) |
| `record` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The record account to be deleted |
| `class?` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Optional class account of the record |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { deleteRecord } from "srs-lib";

const transaction = deleteRecord(context, {
    authority: authority,
    record: recordPublicKey,
    class: classPublicKey // Optional, but recommended for permissioned classes
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The authority must be either the record owner or the class authority (for permissioned classes)
- This operation is permanent and cannot be undone
- All record data will be permanently removed from the blockchain
- For permissioned classes, providing the class account is recommended to ensure proper authority verification
- The record's associated token (if any) must be burned before deleting the record

# Update Record

Updates the data of an existing record while preserving its ownership and other properties.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `authority` | `Signer` | The record owner or class authority (for permissioned classes) |
| `record` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | The record account to be updated |
| `systemProgram?` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Optional System Program account |
| `class?` | `PublicKey \| Pda` | Optional class account of the record |
| `data` | `string` | New serialized data for the record |

## Returns

Returns a `TransactionBuilder` that can be used to build and send the transaction.

## Example

```typescript
import { updateRecord } from "srs-lib";

const transaction = updateRecord(context, {
    authority: authority,
    record: recordPublicKey,
    systemProgram: systemProgramPublicKey,
    class: classPublicKey, // Optional, but recommended for permissioned classes
    data: JSON.stringify({
        title: "Updated Record Title",
        description: "Updated record description",
        // Additional data fields conforming to the class schema
    })
});

// Send the transaction
await transaction.sendAndConfirm();
```

## Important Notes

- The authority must be either the record owner or the class authority (for permissioned classes)
- The record must not be frozen
- The new data must conform to the schema defined in the record's class
- The data must be properly serialized
- The record's ownership and expiration remain unchanged
- For permissioned classes, providing the class account is recommended to ensure proper authority verification
- This operation can be performed multiple times
- The data update is permanent and cannot be undone

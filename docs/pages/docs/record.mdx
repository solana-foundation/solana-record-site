# Record

A record is an instance of a class. It is created under a class and contains the data for that record.

## Structure

### Typescript

```typescript
export type RecordAccountData = {
    discriminator: number;
    class: PublicKey;
    ownerType: number;
    owner: PublicKey;
    isFrozen: boolean;
    expiry: bigint;
    name: string;
    data: string;
};
```

### Rust

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Record<'info> {
    /// The class this record belongs to
    pub class: Pubkey,
    /// The owner_type enum
    pub owner_type: OwnerType,
    /// The owner of this record
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    /// Whether the record is frozen
    pub is_frozen: bool,
    /// Optional expiration timestamp, if not set, the expiry is [0; 8]
    pub expiry: i64,
    /// The record name/key
    pub name: &'info str,
    /// The record's data content
    pub data: &'info str,
}
```
